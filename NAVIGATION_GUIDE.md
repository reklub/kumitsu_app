## Troubleshooting Navigation

**Q: I don't see "Manage" link on the club**
- A: Make sure you're on a tournament's details page
- Click directly on the tournament name (not on the "Manage Tournament" button)

**Q: I don't see the "Batch Upload (CSV)" button**
- A: You might be on the wrong page
- Make sure you're on the participants list (you should see a table of participants)
- The button should be at the bottom in green

**Q: After uploading, I don't see the participants**
- A: Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or F5)
- The participants should appear in the list above the buttons
